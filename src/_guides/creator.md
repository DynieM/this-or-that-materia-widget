## Details ##

Upon initializing the creator, you will be prompted to provide a title for your widget, and can also opt out of the tutorial if desired. The tutorial will walk you through entering the question text, correct and incorrect images, and labels.

Note that labels are not visible to the user - they are intended primarily for accessibility purposes when the widget is played using a screenreader.

By default, questions will be ordered based on their arrangement in the creator - if you wish to randomize the ordering of questions when played, select the **Randomize Question Order** toggle on the top-right.
